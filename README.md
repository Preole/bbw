BareBonesWiki v0.2.0
====================

BareBonesWiki is a succinct personal wiki in one standalone HTML file. It's 
a versatile toolbox for information organization, owing to the invention of 
?<www>-[WikiWikiWeb]. It's free, standalone, and works on any reasonably 
modern web browsers.

Hiatus Notice
-------------

If you've noticed the lack of commits or changes, I have decided to take a 
break from the project to think of a more extensible and maintainable 
architecture, especially regarding user-written plugins & interfaces. The 
project isn't very fun when feature changes and maintenance need to have 
a development environment set up, no matter how trivial that environment 
may be. 

Ideally, I want code editing to be as easy as simply opening up your favorite 
text editor, scroll to the code section, and start editing right away. More 
ideally, The editing can happen right inside BareBonesWiki itself, in the 
original multi-file glory.

I expect development to resume within the end of the first week of October.



Highlights
----------

; Word-processor level functionality
: Tables, lists, block quotations, links; BareBonesWiki has all the 
  essentials of a word processor in readable plain text.

; Source Readability
: Carefully designed base markup language that is readable in 
  source code and modestly easy to learn.

; Versatile Navigation
: Seamlessly jump from one piece of information onto another.

; Free
: Open source project on 2-Clause BSD license.



Usage
-----

   tutorial is necessary, download the user manual in the same directory 
   as well.
   
   If the new version is not satisfactory, you can try one of the older 
   versions in the """distOld/""".
   
2. Open it with a web browser.
3. Enable Javascript, if not enabled already.
4. Enjoy.
