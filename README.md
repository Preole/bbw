BareBonesWiki
=============

BareBonesWiki is a succinct personal wiki in one standalone HTML file. This 
wiki, like any other similar wiki, features non-linear information organization 
schemes designed to fit one's thought process, owing to the invention of the 
?<www>-[WikiWikiWeb], Looking up information is a few keystrokes away, and 
jumping between information pieces is only one click away.

The motivation stems from organizing personal experiences and in a paperback 
notebook. The verdict is that reading is hard, and writing is infinitely 
harder, because data are seldom best organized in linear fashions similar to 
a private diary. Even the most linear kinds of printed work, such as a novel, 
need to have clearly defined sections and table of contents to assist the 
reader, so the readers know what they need to know. The wiki is the closest 
software fitting that mental model for information organization.

Therefore, it makes sense to read a notebook like navigating a wiki. From 
there on, it's all about designing a robust personal notebook.

Current version: **v0.1.4**
