   "title": "Possible Back-end Enhancement",
   "src": "Database\n========\n\nConsider separating tags from wiki entries, rather than \nintegrated as part of wiki entry objects. Tag objects should \nhave its own module for enforcing business constraints, which \nare essential for effective tagging (partitioning) of wiki \nentries based on categories. Specifically, \n\n- There can only be one unique tag per application instance,\n  determined by the tag name.\n- Each tag can refer to at most one unique wiki entry \n  identified by their title text.\n- Similarly, each wiki entry can be tagged at most once by \n  any given tag object.\n- Control characters **must be stripped** from tag names.\n- All consecutive white space characters in tag names **must**\n  be collapsed into a single ASCII white space. However, single\n  non-ASCII space characters are permitted to remain as they \n  are.\n\nWiki entries are not supposed to know which categories they \nbelong to; They should only need to know when they're last \nedited, the date they're created, its title and its source code.\n\n**Wiki entry objects** should also abide to the following rules:\n\n- One unique wiki entry title per application.\n- No control characters allowed in **Mime Type** and **Title**\n  fields.\n- In the same field, process white space in the same way as the \n  tag names do to its white space characters.\n\n\n\nDatabase Indexing\n=================\n\nCurrently, there are seven different kinds of indices in the \nwiki. The code necessary to generate the HTML DOM element and \nthe underlying data structure is verbose, often repeated and \ntedious. This is due to the nature of HTML DOM, which are \nmostly sequential and linear, opposed to a wiki which \nprovides random access.\n\nIf able, these indices should be isolated from the database \nobject as an aggregate, which will be generated on the fly.\n\n\nDatabase Object\n===============\n\nThe database object itself is a bit too simple; It's simply a \nraw javascript object that used property names for different \npurposes, sometimes leaving the property values unused. The \ndesign flaw can be seen with edges (directed links) between \nwiki entries, where an integer value \"1\" is used as a property \nvalue that doesn't contribute anything.\n\nThe database object should be a more formally defined data \nstructure, namely a Graph, with sufficient support for linking in \nreverse direction. Otherwise, finding all nodes that linked to a \nparticular node can be an expensive O(n^^2^^) operation.\n\n\n\nView Controller \n===============\n\nThe code base currently has severe problems with string literals \nrepeatedly used in different areas. The worst offending use case \nare **jQuery CSS selectors**, which often have little to no variation \nfrom one another, but are used as string literals because of the \nCSS selector syntax:\n\n\"\"\"\n$(\"#someConstantModule\").on(\"someEvent\", \".js-wlink\", ...)\n\nfunction doSomething(evt)\n{\n if ($(evt.target).hasClass(\"js-wlink\"))\n {\n  //Do something fancy.\n }\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nHere, the class \"js-wlink\" refers to \"javascript wiki links\", \nwhich opens a wiki entry when they're clicked. Due to the nature \nof CSS selectors, the string value has to be repeated every time \nthere's a different relationship regarding the link, such as \nwhether it's a descendant of a particular kind of \"\"\"div\"\"\". \nInstances of such string constants lead to difficult maintenance.\n\n\n\nAPI & Architecture Design Flaws\n===============================\n\n1. In order to find forward links within a wiki entry, the engine \n   must perform the following procedure every time a wiki entry is \n   saved.\n\n   1. Parse the text into HTML strings.\n   2. Build the HTML DOM.\n   3. Query the DOM for a list of links.\n\n   The third step in the parsing process is critical for indexing \n   orphaned entries and their back links, which are very convenient \n   features to end-users. The other two steps are basic plain text \n   - HTML transformation. None of these steps can be combined or \n   simplified at the current state of affairs.\n\n2. Rendering a wiki entry requires a database query to determine \n   whether to display links in a different way. (Red linking)\n\n3. The rendering engine should not have to generate the same data \n   structure as ones used within the database. (Retrieving \n   edges from HTML DOM)\n\n",

The introduction of the data structure should also \nreduce redundancy for generating data structures for indices. \n(Not yet finished)\n\n\nNew Problems Identified\n-----------------------\n\n- Lack of Error Reporting, both on the UI level and the API level\n- Lack of Error detection and constraint enforcing at the API level\n\n",

Clicking on one of these indexing methods \n  result in wiki entries being displayed arranged in a specific \n  order. Occurs on clicking the indexing button.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.TAG\"\"\"\n: Launches a popup modal box displaying the list of wiki entries \n  under a specific tag. Occurs when a tag hyperlink is clicked.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.SAVE\"\"\"\n: Serializes this entire application into one single HTML file, \n  where the location is to be specified by the user.\n\n  Alternatively, saves a configuration object into the data store.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.EXPORT\"\"\"\n: Serializes the database into a JSON file for saving.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.IMPORT\"\"\"\n: Loads a plain text file into the database for viewing, or loads \n  a JSON file and merge that database into the current one, \n  overwriting any name conflicts.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.LOAD\"\"\"\n: Used by various static, hidden form elements for populating \n  the interface with data, and showing themselves.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.CLOSE\"\"\"\n: Closes or destroys the container window, such as an editing \n  form or a modal popup box. This is a generic event.\n\n\n\nThe following events are specific to the content area where \nwiki entries are displayed:\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.CLOSEO\"\"\"\n: Closes all open wiki entries except the one that initiated\n  this event.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.EDIT\"\"\"\n: Switches an open wiki entry into editing mode.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.COMMIT\"\"\"\n: Saves the wiki entry being edited into the database (memory).\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.CANCEL\"\"\"\n: Discard changes and switch the wiki entry back to view mode.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.DELETE\"\"\"\n: Removes the wiki entry from storage.\n\n; \"\"\"EVT.OPEN\"\"\"\n; Opens a wiki entry with a particular title for viewing.\n\n\nNew Problems Identified\n-----------------------\n\n- The popup modal box tag hyperlinks and indexing button does not \n  always appear right underneath the said elements under Firefox 27.\n\n- When importing an external plain text file, the wiki engine always \n  treat the input as a data set regardless of the choices made in the \n  radio buttons.\n\n- There's no way to specify the expected charset when importing a \n  file.\n\n\n\nClosing\n-------\n\nStill pondering how to organize the database code so it's more human-\nreadable. Still wondering where to put the mime type registry, and \nstill massively refactoring my code. Also forgot to finish my sentences.",
