   "src": "Maintaining a linear diary is easy; You record things chronologically \nas they happen. Maintaining a wiki is hard; Despite an army of editors \nat ?<wEditors>-[Wikipedia], there are still plenty of articles with \n\"Red Links\" and inaccurate information that are likely to remain unfixed \nfor eternity. This tutorial outlines many experiences and practices \nthat will hopefully help in maintaining your wiki.\n\n:{wEditors}: http://gizmodo.com/5926562/wikipedia-is-running-out-of-editors-and-admins\n\n\n\nRequirements Analysis\n---------------------\n\nThe first thing you need to do is finding out why you needed a personal \nnotebook in the first place. This reason alone will determine your \nrequirement for your personal notebook, which will help you use the \nnotebook to a fuller potential. You may or may not need to organize your \nnotebook by date, tags, or any other fancy indexing methods depending on \nwhat, and who you are writing for.\n\nHere are a few common use cases for a notebook application:\n\n- Chronological journals (As a writer)\n- Dictionary (As a student)\n- Reference Materials\n- Knowledge base (As a busy worker)\n- Lecture presentations (As a presenter or teacher)\n\nAnd here are some common subjects one may write about:\n\n- Personal experiences\n- Electrical Engineering\n- Mathematics\n- Gossip cultures\n- Compiling an Encyclopedia\n- Skin care regimen\n\nThese decisions, amongst many others, will influence the keywords \nyou'll need to include in this particular knowledge network. For \nexample, Elementary-level mathematics would do well to include \narithmetic and order of operation, but complex vocabularies such \nas \"matrix\" and \"probability\" should be avoided.\n\nOnce you have decided the subject you're writing about and settled \non your audience, it's time to decide the way this wiki is written. \n\nSince I'm nowhere near an experienced writer or publisher, I can \nonly say that writing a well-organized wiki takes discipline \nsimilar to writing a textbook. That, and I can share some \ntechniques to a more maintainable wiki.\n\nAnd if your subject is hard, you may need to be disciplined like \n?<DK>-[Donald Knuth] when he's authoring \"The Art of Computer \nProgramming\", or designing \"LaTeX\".\n\n:{DK}: http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/\n\n\nTechniques\n----------\n\nTo maintain an easily navigable knowledge base, here are a few \ntechniques you can use to organize your wiki.\n\n1. Pick a good title that's easy to remember and type, such as a \n   catch phrase. This is extremely important because you don't \n   want to rename your titles when there are 100 entries pointing \n   at it. **Avoid renaming titles unless absolutely necessary.**\n\n   Relinking entries by hand is tedious work. If you need to specify \n   subtitles, you should put them inside the content area rather \n   than changing the title.\n\n   (May add automatic relinking as a feature in the future)\n\n2. Title naming scheme: \"\"\"CamelCase\"\"\" \n   \n   Omit spaces between words and phrases for subject titles, \n   because spaces contribute little semantics for these use cases, \n   while they add rooms for typos.\n\n3. Title naming scheme: \"\"\"all lower cases\"\"\" or \"\"\"UPPER CASES\"\"\"\n\n   Similar argument as \"\"\"CamelCase:\"\"\" Letter cases don't add much \n   to semantics.\n\n4. Substitute spaces with underscores, dashes, or any other \n   punctuation characters.\n\n5. Namespace prefix or suffix: \"\"\"Tutorial (Soap Making)\"\"\"\n\n   If you have a namespace conflict from two entries having the same \n   title, use a categorical prefix or suffix to disambiguate these \n   entries.\n\nThese rules apply to tagging as well; Keep the number of tags to a \nmanageable level, so that each tag has significant impact in \norganizing information. Here are a few more rules regarding tag \nuses.\n\n1. **Tags are only useful if there are at least two entries of the \n   same category.**\n\n   A lone article that doesn't fit into any category can organize \n   itself, while many articles of the same categories should be \n   grouped together.\n\n2. Tag entries with very similar titles into different categories\n   (Like multiple tutorial articles on different subjects).\n\nFinally, here are some general guidelines.\n\n1. Use the indexing feature to find and fix **Orphan** or \n   **Missing** entries. Orphans are bad, because they are \n   disconnected pieces of data that adds little value to the wiki. \n   Meanwhile, Missing entries are bad since non-existent data \n   implies an incomplete knowledge base with rooms for improvement.\n\n2. Use the WikiLink syntax \"\"\"#<>\"\"\" whenever you need to include \n   information from other subjects.\n\n3. Save often without overwriting the original file, and verify your \n   save.\n\nMost importantly, Focus on your content first, then focus your effort \non organizing or the other way around; Either way, use your full \nattention to either of these tasks.",

The verdict is that reading is hard, and writing is infinitely \nharder, because data are seldom best organized in linear fashions similar to \na private diary. Even the most linear kinds of printed work, such as a novel, \nneed to have clearly defined sections and table of contents to assist the \nreader, so the readers know what they need to know.

No proprietary software needed, no Internet connection \n    necessary, and impossible to miss as a single standalone HTML file, \n    all without forgetting about languages other than English.\n  \n    Moreover, it's extremely small, clocking in @ ~120KB in its empty\n    state uncompressed.\n\n; Free\n\n  : Open source project on 2-Clause BSD license.\n\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n1.

This design \nis to facilitate a document's logical structure, which is largely controlled \nby indentation.\n\nFollowing that, indentation is syntactically significant in BakaBakaMark.\n\nNext, there is no \"\"\"\\\\t\"\"\", or horizontal tabs in BakaBakaMark. **One tab \nkey-press equates to one space character** for the purpose of determining \nindentation level.\n\nFinally, If you prefer to use the tab key to produce indentation, configure \nyour text editor to insert X spaces instead of tab characters on tab key \npress, where X is your preferred indentation unit.\n\n\n\nMain Syntax\n-----------\n\nThis section is a quick overview of everything you need to lookup about \nBakaBakaMark. For each basic element in this language, I will provide a \nshort, but comprehensive demonstration for that element.\n\n\n\n. Block Level Elements\n=== Block Level Elements ===\n\nBlock level elements in BakaBakaMark, like block elements in HTML, are \nelements that are displayed as 'blocks'. They're displayed as rectangular \nboxes that are stretched as high and wide as they can be, within reason. \nIn general, they serve as containers for other elements in the document, \nsuch as plain text.\n\nFor a quick summary of commonly used elements, please consult the following \ntable.\n\n|====\n!!

Paragraphs\n==== Paragraphs ====\n \nTo generate a paragraph, type away. This is the basic building block of most \nkinds of writing.\n\nTo generate multiple paragraphs, put one or more blank lines in between by \npressing the **Enter** key twice.\n\nParagraph text need to be lined up against the block's left margin, which \nis determined by the indentation of first visible character that started \nthe paragraph block. Specifically:\n\n\"\"\"\n  This is \n  preferred. \n  Everything is lining up \n  against the left-margin.\n  \n  This is acceptable, if one wants to ensure spaces are visible within the\n   same paragraph, if manual line breaks are not to be interpreted as white\n   spaces. Some typesetting tools and markup languages, such as HTML, treat \n   line breaks as white space for automatic word-wrapping by default.\n   \n  This treatment is okay for English and most languages from the\n   Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, but that line break conversion is going to \n   cause problems in other alphabets.\n   \n  Some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) don't have space\n   characters in their alphabet. If writers were to write in such a language,\n   and they want to manually line-wrap their text, they're going to see\n   unwanted space in their text because of the conversion from line break\n   to space.\n   \n  BakaBakaMark can be configured eliminate that conversion for writers who\n   prefer to manually line-wrap in such languages. If one enables that\n   configuration and one wishes to deliberately preserve the space in a \n   visible manner, one can write in this style.\n   \n  Alternatively, one can put the space at the end of every line. This \n  results in invisible syntax, which can be difficult to track down if \n  line breaks are not interpreted as spaces.\n   \n  This is bad. Insufficient \n indentation level terminates the ongoing paragraph and \n starts a new one.\n\"\"\"\n\nThere is no forced line break syntax, invisible or otherwise. Consecutive \nspaces and line breaks shall be collapsed into **one** space in an ordinary \nparagraph.\n\nIf line breaks are really necessary, one can use **Fenced Code Block** or \n**PreFormatted Paragraph**. The former ignores all BakaBakaMark syntaxes, \nwhile the latter works like an ordinary paragraph, except all white spaces \nand new lines are preserved.\n\n\n. Fenced Code Blocks\n==== Fenced Code Blocks ====\n\nThree or more typewriter's double quotes \"\"\"\\\"\"\"\" on a blank line starts a \nfenced code block. No BakaBakaMark syntax will be parsed inside, and all \nwhite space as well as invisible line breaks shall be preserved.\n\nTo end a fenced code block, use the same number of double quotes on another \nblank line, on the same column as the opening fence.\n\n\"\"\"\n\\\"\"\"\nThis\n  Is\nFenced\n  Code Block\n\\\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\n\nAny negatively indented text in the fenced code block shall be treated as \nhaving no indentation.\n\nForgetting to close a fenced code block will turn the rest of the document \ninto a code block.\n\n\n. Blockquotes\n==== Blockquotes ====\n\nBegin a line with a \"\"\">\"\"\", or greater than sign, followed by the content just \nlike Usenet-style quoting. The blockquote element can contain any other \nblock-level element, including nested blockquotes.\n\n> Artillery adds dignity to what would otherwise be a vulgar brawl.\n\n  -- Frederick The Great\n  \n\"\"\"\n> Artillery adds dignity to what would otherwise be a vulgar brawl.\n\n  -- Frederick The Great\n\"\"\"\n  \nUnlike Usenet-style quoting, only the starting line needs to be prefixed. \nAll other lines need to be left without a prefix.\n\nTo indicate nesting, as well as blockquotes containing multiple blocks, \nuse space-based indentation and make sure the blocks are aligned on the \nsame column.\n\n> Joe wrote:\n\n  > I will be coming to see you on Tuesday.\n    Please invite your friends.\n    We're going to have a lot of fun.\n\n  Who should I invite exactly?\n  \n\"\"\"\n> Joe wrote:\n\n  > I will be coming to see you on Tuesday.\n    Please invite your friends.\n    We're going to have a lot of fun.\n\n  Who should I invite exactly?\n\"\"\"\n\n\n. Headers\n==== Headers ====\n\nBakaBakaMark supports two kinds of headers: The \"One-Liner\" and the \nmulti-line SeTeXT style header. \n\nFor the One-Liner, begin a line with one or more equal signs \"\"\"=\"\"\", \nfollowed by one space. This line of text shall be parsed in verbatim.\nIf you're aesthetically inclined, you can end the one-liner with equal \nsigns as well. These equal signs shall not be rendered in the output.\n\n===== **Example One-Liner Header** =====\n\"\"\"\n===== **Example One-Liner Header** =====\n\"\"\"\n\nIf there are equal signs in your title, you may use them so long as these \nequal signs are not at the end of the line. If they happen to need to be at \nthe end of the line, you may append an invisible white space after it to \nforce it to render.\n\n\"\"\"\n===== One-Liner = Quick and Easy ===== \n\"\"\"\n\nThe less equal signs there are, the more important the header is. \n\n\"\"\"\n= <h1>\n== <h2>\n=== <h3>\n==== <h4>\n===== <h5>\nSix or more \"=\" -> <h6>\n\"\"\"\n\n\nThe \"SeTeXT\" style header is done by underlining a paragraph with at least \none equal sign \"\"\"=\"\"\", or four or more hyphen-minus \"\"\"-\"\"\". The equal \nsign shall yield the most important header <h1>, while the hyphens shall \nyield <h2>. \n\n\"\"\"\nThis is a Setext Header. Good for \nLong Document Titles and document \nsource aesthetics.\n===========\n\nThis is a Setext Header\n---------------\n\"\"\"\n\n\n. Horizontal Lines\n==== Horizontal Lines ====\n\nTo produce a horizontal line or a thematic break, start a line with four \nor more hyphen-minus and end the line immediately after.\n\n---------------\n\nIn HTML, this shall render as <hr>.\n\n\"\"\"\n---------------\n\"\"\"\n\n. Lists\n==== Lists ====\n\nThere are three different types of list structures available in BakaBakaMark: \nBullet Lists, Ordered Lists, and Definition Lists. \n\n\n\n. Bullet List\n===== Bullet List =====\n\nBullet lists are easy; Start a line with any of the characters {\"\"\"* + -\n\"\"\"} or a Unicode bullet symbol, followed by one white space. This creates a \nbullet, and consecutive bullets shall be merged together into a bullet list.\n\n* Item 1\n+ Item 2\n- Item 3\n\n\"\"\"\n* Item 1\n+ Item 2\n- Item 3\n\"\"\"\n\n\nBullet lists can be nested in the same way as blockquotes. Use indentation \nto determine the logical structure.\n\n* Item 1\n\n  Item 1 continued.\n  \n  * Item 1 Bullet 1\n  * Item 1 Bullet 2\n  \n    > A blockquote.\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    A code block\n      Positive indentation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n  * Item 1 Bullet 3.\n  \n  Item 1 epilogue.\n  \n* Item 2\n* Item 3\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n* Item 1\n\n  Item 1 continued.\n  \n  * Item 1 Bullet 1\n  * Item 1 Bullet 2\n  \n    > A blockquote.\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    A code block\n      Positive indentation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n  * Item 1 Bullet 3.\n  \n  Item 1 epilogue.\n  \n* Item 2\n* Item 3\n\"\"\"\n\nEmpty bullet list items are removed from the syntax tree. If such removal \noperations empties the bullet list, the list is removed as well.\n\n\n. Ordered List\n===== Ordered List =====\n\nOrdered List follow the same rule as bullet list, except you start a line \nwith an Arabic number, a single period \"\"\".\"\"\", and a space.\n\nAlternatively, you may also use a number sign \"\"\"#\"\"\" in place of Arabic \nnumbers. You may even mix them within the same numbered list.\n\n1. One\n2. Two\n#. Three\n4. Four\n\n\"\"\"\n1. One\n2. Two\n#. Three\n4. Four\n\"\"\"\n\n\nIf you need to create two separate lists without rendering explicit content \nbetween the list, use a single period on a blank line.\n\n1. Item 1\n2. Item 2\n3. Item 3\n.\n1. Not 4\n2. Not 5\n3. Not 6\n\n\"\"\"\n1. Item 1\n2. Item 2\n3. Item 3\n.\n1. Not 4\n2. Not 5\n3. Not 6\n\"\"\"\n\n. Definition List\n===== Definition List =====\n\nA definition list is one or more pairs of terms and their descriptions.\n\nTo specify a term, start a line with a semi-colon \"\"\";\"\"\" and a space, \nfollowed by the term to be defined. This term block may not contain a block \nelement such as a blockquote. (Though it can contain images, links and other \nformatting.)\n\nTo specify a description, use the same syntax as a term, except use a colon \n\"\"\":\"\"\" instead. The description block may contain other block elements.\n\nConsecutive descriptions and terms will be collapsed into a single \ndescription group or term, respectively.\n\n\n; Term 1\n; Term 2\n; Term 3\n: Description 1\n\n  Another paragraph in description 1.\n  \n: Description 2\n: Description 3\n\n\"\"\"\n; Term 1\n; Term 2\n; Term 3\n: Description 1\n\n  Another paragraph in description 1.\n  \n: Description 2\n: Description 3\n\"\"\"\n\n; **Term A**\n: Description for ''Term A''\n; Term B\n: Description for Term B\n; __Term C__\n: Description for __Term C__\n\n\"\"\"\n; **Term A**\n: Description for ''Term A''\n; Term B\n: Description for Term B\n; __Term C__\n: Description for __Term C__\n\"\"\"\n\nEmpty terms and descriptions are removed from the definition list. Terms \nat the end of the list, and descriptions at the beginning of the list shall \nbe removed. If a definition list becomes empty as a result, it shall be \nremoved as well.\n\n: This is not allowed.\n; This list shall be removed.\n\n\"\"\"\n: This is not allowed.\n; This list shall be removed.\n\"\"\"\n\n. Tables\n==== Tables ====\n\nBakaBakaMark provides simple table support with two kinds of cells; A header \ncell and an ordinary data cell. They may be nested, and they may contain \nother block elements similar to the rules used by blockquotes and other \nblock level elements.\n\nA table cell begins with two pipe symbols \"\"\"||\"\"\", while a header cell uses \nexclaimation mark instead. \"\"\"!!\"\"\". Consecutive table cells or header cells \nare merged into a table row, while a row separator consisting of a pipe and \nat least one equal signs \"\"\"|===\"\"\" denotes a new row start.\n\n!! Row 1 Column 1\n!! Row 1 Column 2\n\n   > This cell has a blockquote.\n|====\n|| Row 2 Column 1\n|| Row 2 Column 2\n\n\"\"\"\n!! Row 1 Column 1\n!! Row 1 Column 2\n\n   > This cell has a blockquote.\n|====\n|| Row 2 Column 1\n|| Row 2 Column 2\n\"\"\"\n\nIf you're aesthetically inclined, you may wrap a pair of row separators \naround the table. This does not affect the output in any way.\n\n\"\"\"\n|====\n!! Row 1 Column 1\n!! Row 1 Column 2\n|====\n|| Row 2 Column 1\n|| Row 2 Column 2\n|====\n\"\"\"\n\nHere's a short list of table semantics:\n\n- The table's first row determines the number of columns the table shall \n  have on each row.\n- Rows with too many columns (cells) shall be trimmed. \n- Empty rows are dropped.\n- Rows with at least one cell declared shall be padded with empty cells, \n  up to the table's declared column count.\n- Empty table cells are allowed, where as other empty block elements are not.\n\nCell content alignment and merged table cells are unlikely to be \nimplemented, if ever.\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n. Comment Block\n==== Comment Block ====\n\nComment blocks are text that gets excluded from the output. They are to \nremain invisible except for the author or the editor, who need to leave \nsome notes inside the document without having them rendered at all.\n\nBegin the block by fencing the area off with at least four forward slashes. \n\"\"\"////\"\"\" End the block in the same way as the beginning fence, with the \nslashes starting on the same column. If this block is to come after a \nparagraph, there needs to be a blank line in between them.\n\n\"\"\"\nSome paragraph...\n\n////\nThis shall not be rendered in the output.\n////\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\n. Block Stopper\n==== Block Stopper ====\n\nThis element is useful for stopping an ongoing block element, such as \nsplitting a long numbered list into two different lists without producing \nany output. \n\nStart a line with \"\"\".\"\"\" and end the line immediately.\n\n\"\"\"\n.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\n. Aside Blocks\n==== Aside Blocks ====\n\nThis element is a block wrapper that can contain other block elements. \nIt has no semantic meaning, and no presentational effect.\n\nBegin a line with four or more asterisks, then fill in the block elements \nstarting on the next line. End the Aside Block with the same number of \nasterisks on a blank line on the same column as the starting asterisks.\n\n\"\"\"\n****\nThis is an Aside\n****\n\n-->\n\n<div>\n<p>this is an Aside</p>\n</div>\n\"\"\"\n\nThis element is meant to be combined with the Label ID and Label Class \nelements, which creates CSS handles for a group of elements that can be used \nto enhance presentation.\n\n\n\n. Reference Link Anchors\n==== Reference Link Anchors ====\n\nReference Link Anchors are primarily used to isolate long-winding ugly URL \nfrom the main text sections using hyperlinks. Instead of specifying the URL, \none may specify an identifier of a reference link anchor, which will \nsubstitute the identifier with the URL the anchor is holding.\n\nStart a line with a colon and an opening brace, \"\"\":{\"\"\", followed by the \nidentifier, then close the ID with a closing brace and another colon. \"\"\"}:\"\"\"\nThe rest of the line is the URL, word for word.\n\nThis paragraph contains ?<google>-[A hyperlink to Google].\n\n:{google}: http://www.google.ca/\n\n\"\"\"\nThis paragraph contains ?<google>-[A hyperlink to Google].\n\n:{google}: http://www.google.ca/\n\"\"\"\n\nThe order of the Reference Link Anchor declaration doesn't matter. If \nanchors with identical IDs are declared, the most recently defined anchor \nshall be used.\n\nAdditionally, Reference Link Anchors have resolution scopes. An anchor \ndeclared inside a more deeply nested block element shall be used before \nan anchor with the same name in a less nested block elements.\n\n?<Wikipedia>-[I'm going to the Wikipedia's French section.]\n\n:{Wikipedia}: http://fr.wikipedia.org/\n\n> :{Wikipedia}: http://en.wikipedia.org/\n\n  ?<Wikipedia>-[I'm going to Wikipedia's English section, not the \n  French section.]\n\n\"\"\"\n?<Wikipedia>-[I'm going to the Wikipedia's French section.]\n\n:{Wikipedia}: http://fr.wikipedia.org/\n\n> :{Wikipedia}: http://en.wikipedia.org/\n\n  ?<Wikipedia>-[I'm going to Wikipedia's English section, not the \n  French section.]\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\n. Class Label\n==== Class Label ====\n\nThis construct gives the next block-level element a type label. In HTML, \nthis allows the element to be selected and modified by CSS for special \nvisual effects, such as image blocks with text-wrapping. \n\nBegin a line with two periods and a white space, followed by the name \nof the class on the rest of the line. White space characters are dropped \nin the final output of the class name. To declare multiple classes for a \nblock element, use more class label elements.\n\n\"\"\"\n.. left\n.. red\n****\n!<Image>-[Alt Text]\n\nSome caption text for a left-floating image with text wrapping and \ncaption.\n****\n\"\"\"\n\nResult sample code, which can be utilized by the CSS backend.\n\n\"\"\"\n<div class=\"bbm-left bbm-red\">\n <p>\n <img src=\"Image\" alt=\"Alt Text\">\n </p>\n <p>\n Some caption text for a left-floating image with text wrapping and \ncaption.\n </p>\n</div>\n\"\"\"\n\n\n. ID Label\n==== ID Label ====\n\nSame effect as the Class Label, except that each unique ID can only appear \nonce in the entire document, and each block element can only be assigned one \nID. It's primarily used as an anchor for internal links, which allows \nintra-document navigation.\n\nBegin an ID label like a Class Label, except there's only one period. The \nrest is the same as a Class Label. Here's a live example of an ID label in \naction, along with the Internal Link element.\n\n#[toc]-[Go to the table of content, which is at the top of the page]\n\n\"\"\"\n. toc\n\nTable of Content\n================\n\n[...]\n\n#[toc]-[Table of Content]\n\"\"\"\n\n\nSubsequent declaration of the same ID has no effect. If there are multiple \nID Labels for the same block element, the last declared ID shall be used. \nAll previously declared ID are wasted and can no longer be used in later \nparts of the document.\n\n\"\"\"\n. toc\n. toc2 \n\nTable of Content\n================\n\n\"toc\" has no effect and cannot be re-used. Only \"toc2\" is used on the \nSetext header.\n\"\"\"\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n. Inline Level Elements\n=== Inline Level Elements ===\n\nInline elements are syntactical constructs that occur within lines of text. \nTheir primary purpose here is to display hyperlinks, show images, and add \nvisual effects and semantics to a block of uneventful text. \n\n\n. Text Formatting\n==== Text Formatting ====\n\nThe following table details the text formatting elements available in \nBakaBakaMark.\n\n|====\n!! Effect Desired\n!! Sample Source Code\n!! Render\n!!

Code Snippet (Literal Text)\n|| \"\"\"\\\"\"\"void **ptr;\"\"\\\"\"\"\"\n|| \"\"\"void **ptr;\"\"\"\n|| \"\"\"<code>\"\"\"\n|====\n\nThere are a few simple rules to remember, which applies to images and \nhyperlinks as well.\n\n- Proper Tag Nesting\n\n  Make sure the opening and closing formatting tags are properly nested. \n  That is, it's wrong to have two different text formatting tags cross into \n  each others' boundaries.\n  \n  \"\"\"\n  **This section is bold, ''**but this section is not Italic, because \n  the bold section closed off the start of the Italic section.''\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  **This section is bold, ''**but this section is not Italic, because \n  the bold section closed off the start of the Italic section.''\n  \n  BakaBakaMark will resolve the conflict using left-association; That is, \n  the first declared formatting will be applied first, while the rest of \n  improperly nested elements shall be rendered literally.\n  \n- Close Off Tags.\n\n  Remember to close the formatting tags. Failing to close the tag causes \n  the tag itself to remain in the paragraph literally, though it will have \n  no adverse effect to the rest of the paragraph.\n  \n  **Oops. Forgot to close the bold text. ''Fortunately, Italics still work.''\n  \n  The only exception is the **Code Snippet** \"\"\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\"\"\" which will render \n  the rest of the paragraph literally, even if they are properly nested.\n  \n  \"\"\"Oops. Forgot to close the code snippet. This means ''even properly \n  formatted Italics will cease to work.''\n  \n- Text formatting can cross lines, but not paragraphs.\n\n  **This is not bold.\n  \n  This is not bold**\n  \n- Matching Quote Counts for Code Snippets\n\n  Code Snippets can only be closed using the same number of double quote \n  characters. (At least three) This enables \"\"\"nested code snippets without \n  relying on \"\"\"\"\\\\\"\"\"\", or backslash escapes\"\"\", which makes the source \n  code really ugly.\n\n\n. Hyperlinks & Images\n==== Hyperlinks & Images Quick Summary ====\n\n|====\n!! Link Type\n!! Sample Source Code\n!! HTML Render\n!! HTML Source\n!! Notes\n|====\n!! Content Transclusion\n|| \"\"\"\n   !<WikiTitle>-[.]\n   \"\"\"\n|| !<WikiTitle>-[.]\n|| Depends on the content of #<WikiTitle>.\n   If the destination doesn't exist, some\n   placeholder HTML shall be returned \n   instead.\n|| An image element that is the sole child \n   of a paragraph element, with the alt text \n   \"\"\".\"\"\" shall be treated as a transclusion \n   link. The link and the containing paragraph \n   shall be replaced by the content of the \n   targeted wiki entry.\n\n   This element only works within the context \n   of BareBonesWiki.\n|====\n!! Hyperlinked Image (No Alt Text)\n|| \"\"\"\n   ?<about:blank>-[!<noImg.jpg>]\n   \"\"\"\n|| ?<about:blank>-[!<noImg.jpg>]\n|| \"\"\"\n   <a href=\"about:blank\"><img src=\"noImg.jpg\" alt=\"Figure\"></a>\n   \"\"\"\n|| A placeholder alt text shall be generated for such images. (So that \n   links containing non-existing images are still accessible.)\n|====\n!! External Link (No Custom Display Text)\n|| \"\"\"\n   ?<about:blank>\n   \"\"\"\n|| ?<about:blank>\n|| \"\"\"\n   <a href=\"about:blank\">about:blank</a>\n   \"\"\"\n|| The display text shall be set to the destination URL by default.\n|====\n!! External Link\n|| \"\"\"\n   ?<about:blank>-[**Bold** Custom display text.]\n   \"\"\"\n|| ?<about:blank>-[**Bold** Custom display text.]\n|| \"\"\"\n   <a href=\"about:blank\"><strong>Bold</strong> Custom display text.</a>\n   \"\"\"\n|| Standard web link syntax. Permits absolute URL as well as relative URL. \n   Does not perform any guessing on the URL's protocol, if the protocol \n   declaration (such as \"\"\"http://\"\"\")is omitted in the URL string.\n   \n   Preserves all white space characters.\n|====\n!! Image\n|| \"\"\"\n   !<Image.jpg>-[Specify Alt Text Here]\n   \"\"\"\n|| !<Image.jpg>-[Specify Alt Text Here]\n|| \"\"\"\n   <img src=\"Image.jpg\" alt=\"Specify Alt Text Here\">\n   \"\"\"\n|| Significant white space are preserved, but **all** control characters, \n   including line breaks, are stripped within the alt text attribute.\n|====\n!! Internal Link (Within the document)\n|| \"\"\"\n   #[toc]-[Go to Table of Content]\n   \"\"\"\n|| #[toc]-[Go to Table of Content]\n|| \"\"\"\n   <a href=\"#bbm-toc\">Go to Table of Content</a>\n   \"\"\"\n|| This link syntax is primarily used to navigate within the same document, \n   with anchor points defined by the **ID Label** Element.\n|====\n!! Wiki Link\n|| \"\"\"\n   #<about:blank>-[Custom Display Text]\n   \"\"\"\n|| #<about:blank>-[Custom Display Text]\n|| \"\"\"\n   <a href=\"about:blank\" class=\"bbm-wiki\">Custom Display Text</a>\n   \"\"\"\n|| By default, has the same effect as an external link. This link can be \n   targetted by CSS/Javascript selectors, which allows platform-specific \n   behaviors unique to a particular website, such as a short-hand wiki \n   link that points to a page within the same site.\n|====\n\n\n. Images\n==== Images ====\n\nTo create an image, start with an exclaimation mark, followed by a \"\"\"<\"\"\" \nor opening angle bracket. Place the URL inside the angle brackets, and end \nthe URL with a closing angle bracket \"\"\">\"\"\". You may span the URL across \nmultiple lines, so long as there's no blank lines in between them. \n\n\"\"\"\n!<http://www.somesite.com/\nsome/path/to/image-file.jpg>\n\"\"\"\n\nLine break characters, trailing and leading space are automatically stripped \nfrom the output. Significant white space are preserved.\n\nIf you want to specify an alt text, use a pair of square bracket, with the \nopening square bracket preceded by a hyphen. Put the alt text inside the \nsquare brackets. \n\nYou may use square brackets in the alt text so long as opening and closing \nsquare brackets are balanced. (This rule also applies to display texts in \n**Hyperlinks** and the URL for **Internal Link**.)\n\n\"\"\"\n!<http://www.somesite.com/some/path/to/image-file.jpg>-[Alt Text [...] Rest \nomitted.]\n\"\"\"\n\nYou may start the square brackets on a different line if you want a cleaner \nlooking source document, as long as the hyphen is right before the opening \nsquare bracket, and there's no visible character between the hyperlink and \nthe closing angle bracket.\n\n\"\"\"\n!<http://[... Some very long URL]>\n-[This alt text is on a new line.]\n\"\"\"\n\n\n. Hyperlinks\n==== Hyperlinks ====\n\nHyperlinks are created in largely the same manner as images with a few \nvariations.\n\n\"\"\"?<>\"\"\" denotes standard **External Links** pointing to other URLs. The \nquestion mark denotes a mysterious location in the Internet.\n\n?<http://www.google.com>\n\n\"\"\"\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com</a>\n</p>\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"#<>\"\"\" denotes **Extensible External Links**, which may have special \neffects depending on the hosting backend. By default, they have the same \nbehavior as an external link.\n\n\"\"\"#[]\"\"\" denotes **Internal Link**, which jumps to a different location \nwithin the same document. This is most useful for large documents that \nspan multiple pages.\n\nBy default, the link's display text is the URL of the hyperlinks. They can \nbe changed in the same way as image alt text: Add a hyphen-minus before \nthe pair of square brackets around the display text.\n\n?<http://www.google.com>-[This hyperlink plus __[...]__ omitted content \npoints to {--Yahoo--} {++Google.com++}]\n\n#[toc]-[This Internal Link goes to the Table of Content.]\n\n\"\"\"\n?<http://www.google.com>-[This hyperlink plus __[...]__ omitted content \npoints to {--Yahoo--} {++Google.com++}]\n\n#[toc]-[This Internal Link goes to the Table of Content.]\n\"\"\"\n\nUnlike the Image Alt Text, inline formatting are permitted inside the \nsquare brackets, so long as it's not a hyperlink element. (Hyperlinks \nwill be treated literally if they're encountered.) \n\n?<http://www.google.com>-[No __nested__ ?<http://www.google.com> allowed.]\n\nTo create clickable hyperlinked image**(s)**, put the images inside the \nsquare brackets of the hyperlink.\n\n\"\"\"\n?<URL>\n-[\n!<Image1>\n!<Image2>\n!<Image3>\n]\n\"\"\"\n\nIn both images and hyperlinks, empty URL values are not permitted. Link \nelements with such URL values shall be rendered literally.\n\n\n\n=== Others ===\n\nAnything else not covered by the main syntax.\n\n\n. Backslash Escape\n==== Backslash Escape ====\n\nIf you need a syntactically significant character to be presented literally, \nadd a backslash \"\"\"\\\\\"\"\" before that character.\n\n\\*\\*This sentence is not bold.\\*\\*\n\nThe backslash character will always be dropped from the output, so if you \nneed to type a backslash character itself, use two backslashes: \"\"\"\\\\\\\\\"\"\".\n\nThis syntax works for any and all context, including verbatim text sections \nsuch as Code Blocks and URL. If these sections of text contain backslash \ncharacters, they'll need to be escaped by doubling the backslashes. The \nsource code:\n\n\"\"\"\n[^\\\\\\\\s|\\\\\\\\s$]\n\"\"\"\n\nAnd the rendered output:\n\n\"\"\"\n[^\\\\s|\\\\s$]\n\"\"\"\n\n",

   "title": "Tutorial: Basic",
   "src": "Welcome to the introductory tutorial for #<BareBonesWiki>. It will \nteach you everything you need to know about the application, and \na few guidelines for authoring a #<Wiki>-[wiki].\n\n\n\nBrowser Support\n---------------\n\nYou should first check whether your web browser supports saving \nback to the file system. You may either... \n\n- Consult #<Web Browser Support>\n- Create a new wiki entry, save it, then save the wiki engine \n  with the save button at the upper right hand corner. Follow \n  the instructions in the popup dialog box, or save the generated \n  download file in your computer.\n- Open the saved wiki with your browser, and locate the wiki \n  entry you've just created. A trip to the Titles (Alphabetical)\n  index should help you locate the entry.\n\n\n\nBasic Workflow\n--------------\n\n1. Create a new wiki entry with the \"new\" button.\n2. Edit the entry. If you need syntax help with editing, refer \n   to the #<Syntax> page.\n\n   Tag this entry as necessary.\n\n3. Click on the \"finish\" button.\n4. Repeat previous steps as needed.\n5. Press the \"save\" button when you feel you've done\n   enough editing.\n6. Confirm your progress by opening the HTML file you've \n   just saved with the browser.\n\nOther buttons, such as \"Delete\" should be self explanatory.\n\n\n\nExporting\n---------\n\nIf you ever need to upgrade the wiki or start fresh, \npress the \"Export\" button to extract the data store \nonto your file system, then use the import wizard in \nyour new wiki to import the data set as in #[Importing]\n\n\n\nImporting\n---------\n\nPress the \"Import\" button. You can import your data in three \ndifferent ways:\n\n; Dataset\n\n  : Valid JSON files you've extracted from another \n    BareBonesWiki HTML file. Invalid JSON files will \n    raise an error, and nothing will happen. Importing \n    data in this manner also imports the configuration\n    settings from another wiki.\n\n; Wiki Entry\n\n  : A plain text file written in #<BakaBakaMark>.\n\n; Plain Text\n\n  : Plain text with no interpretation at all. If you're \n    importing potentially dangerous #<Javascript> files,\n    or you simply don't want any parsing happening, use\n    this option.\n\n; HTML Snippet\n\n  : Straight HTML code. These code can directly affect \n    the wiki itself, and if malicious, have undesirable \n    effects on the browser. Use this option for HTML code \n    you really trust.\n\nNon-textual data such as images and videos are currently not \nsupported.\n\n\n\nIndexing\n--------\n\nThere are many different kinds of indices available to BareBonesWiki, \nlocated at the upper left hand corner of the interface. You may also \nperform a simple full text search in the entire wiki through the \ntext search box. These facilities are used to assist you in finding \nthe entry you're looking for.\n\n; Titles\n\n  : Lists all wiki entries in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.\n\n; Created\n\n  : Lists wiki entries by the date they're created, in units of whole \n    days.\n\n; Recent\n\n  : As **Created**, but sorts by last edit date instead.\n\n; Tags\n\n  : Sorts wiki entries by the tag they're associated with in \n    lexicographical order.\n\n; Orphans\n\n  : Lists entries that have no other entries referring to them, \n    excluding self-loops.\n\n; BackLink\n\n  : List all incoming links for each wiki entry.\n\n; Mime\n\n  : Lists wiki entries by their content (MIME) type, such as plain \n    text, wiki text, or HTML.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n- #<Wiki>\n- #<Tutorial: Maintenance>",
