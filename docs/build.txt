Basic Build Instructions
========================

1. Install ?<http://nodejs.org/>-[node.js]. 

2. Jump to the project's root directory using command-line and type 
   """node build.js""". If you're on Windows, shift-right click the
   open white space in the Explorer window and select """Open 
   command-prompt"""
   
3. Retrieve the generated HTML file in """./dist/""".



Slightly more complicated builds
================================

Assuming you're in the project's root directory in the command line, with 
node.js installed, install the following node.js modules:

"""
npm install jscombiner
npm install fuse
"""

The former is a javascript file concatenator, while the latter is a HTML, 
CSS, and Javascript file injector.

If you'll be using the wiki in older web browsers, Navigate to the source code 
directory and switch jQuery library versions located in """./src/lib/""". 
**Note**: this operation does not enable Internet Explorer 8-9 to commit 
persistent changes to the wiki.

"""
cd src/lib/
cp jQuery1.x.min.js jQuery.min.js
"""

Retrieve the generated HTML file in """./dist/"""





Hard Dependencies
=================

They're already included in the source code, but just in case updates come 
out:

; jQuery 

  : Download the minified library from ?<http://jquery.com/download/>
     -[the official website], then put it into the source folder. Download 
     the 1.x branch if planning to use the wiki with older web browsers.
     (Not Internet Explorer, unfortunately)

; lodash

  : Retrieve the minified compatibility build of lodash from 
    ?<http://lodash.com/>, by John-David Dalton, and drop it off at
    """./src/lib/""".
    
; bbm (BakaBakaMark; The markup syntax used in the wiki)

  : ?<https://github.com/Preole/bbm>

    Simply drag, drop, and replace the old library with the new one.




lodash Custom Build
===================

If memory consumption and saving a few bytes matter, we can build a custom 
version of lodash using **node.js**.

1. Install node.js
2. Install npm (Which comes along with node.js)
3. """
   npm install lodash-cli -g
   """

4. """
   lodash compat category=collections,objects exports=global include=difference,uniq,union,identity,flatten
   """
   
   Switch out """compat""" with """modern""" if you'll always be using
   modern web browsers.
   
5. Drag & drop the minified library into """./src/lib/""".



jQuery Custom Build
===================

Like the lodash custom build, follow these instructions if you're looking 
to save a few extra bytes. This build instruction assumes that the following 
commands are available in the command line shell:

- node (?<node.js>)
- npm (Comes along with node.js)
- git (?<git>)
- grunt-cli ("""npm install grunt-cli -g""")

:{node.js}: http://nodejs.org/
:{git}: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Git/article.html#installation


From the command line in the github directory, clone jQuery's repository
and build its dependencies using the following commands:

"""
git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git
cd jquery
npm run build
"""



After building, run one of the following scripts depending on how modern 
your web browsers will be. For older Gecko and Webkit-based, use the 1.x 
branch:

"""
git checkout 1.11.0
grunt custom:-deferred,-ajax,-effects,-core/ready,-serialize,-event-alias,-callbacks,-queue,-forms,-deprecated,-exports/amd,-css
"""



And if you'll always use the latest browsers, use the 2.x branch.

"""
git checkout 2.1.0
grunt custom:-deferred,-ajax,-effects,-core/ready,-serialize,-event-alias,-callbacks,-queue,-forms,-deprecated,-exports/amd,-css,-sizzle
"""

Drop the minified jquery from """$(jQueryRoot)/dist/jquery.min.js""" 
to the wiki's source directory: """$(bbwRoot)/src/lib/jquery.min.js"""
