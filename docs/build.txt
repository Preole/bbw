Basic Build Instructions
========================

1. Install ?<http://nodejs.org/>-[node.js]. 

2. Jump to the project's root directory using command-line and type 
   """node build.js""". If you're on Windows, shift-right click the
   open white space in the Explorer window and select """Open 
   command-prompt"""
   
3. Retrieve the generated HTML file in """./dist/""".



Slightly more complicated builds
================================

Assuming you're in the project's root directory in the command line, with 
node.js installed, install the following node.js modules:

"""
npm install jscombiner
npm install fuse
"""

The former is a javascript file concatenator, while the latter is a HTML, 
CSS, and Javascript file injector.

If you'll be using the wiki in older web browsers, Navigate to the source code 
directory and switch jQuery library versions located in """./src/lib/""". 
**Note**: this operation does not enable Internet Explorer 8-9 to commit 
persistent changes to the wiki.

"""
cd src/lib/
ren jQuery.min.js jQuery.min.old.js
cp jQuery1.x.min.js jQuery.min.js
"""

Retrieve the generated HTML file in """./dist/"""





Hard Dependencies
=================

They're already included in the source code, but just in case updates come 
out:

; jQuery 

  : Download the minified library from ?<http://jquery.com/download/>
     -[the official website], then put it into the source folder. Download 
     the 1.x branch if planning to use the wiki with older web browsers.
     (Not Internet Explorer, unfortunately)
     
  : Use one of the pre-built jQuery inside """./src/lib/""", or create a 
    custom build of jQuery as explained in the section **jQuery Custom Build**.
    
    Use this option if you're planning to compress your wiki as much as 
    possible.

jQuery Build Instruction
========================

This build instruction assumes that the following commands are available in 
the command line shell:

- node (?<node.js>)
- npm (Comes along with node.js)
- git (?<git>)
- grunt-cli ("""npm install grunt-cli -g""")

:{node.js}: http://nodejs.org/
:{git}: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Git/article.html#installation

From the command line in the github directory, clone jQuery's repository
and build its dependencies using the following commands:

"""
git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git
cd jquery
npm run build
"""

Follow the instruction for building customized jQuery library in its 
readme file.



Choice A: 1.x
-------------

Use the 1.x branch for usages with slightly older, but W3C standards-
compliant web browsers, such as most gecko or webkit-based ones; e.g: 
    
- Firefox 3.6
- Lunascape 5 with Gecko rendering engine
- Avant web browser

Note that this operation does not enable saving changes to the wiki in 
Internet Explorer 8-9, as this is a fundamentally different issue.

Check out the 1.x branch using git. At the time of writing, v1.10.0 is the 
latest jQuery version for this branch. Afterwards, run the custom build 
command via grunt.

"""
git checkout 1.10.0
grunt custom:-deferred,-ajax,-effects,-core/ready,-serialize,-event-alias,-callbacks,-queue,-forms,-deprecated,-exports/amd,-css
"""



Choice B: 2.x
-------------

Checkout the 2.x branch if you'll always be using the latest versions of 
web browsers (Currently 2.1.0). Again, the project uses a custom build to 
exclude unnecessary components.

"""
git checkout 2.1.0
grunt custom:-deferred,-ajax,-effects,-core/ready,-serialize,-event-alias,-callbacks,-queue,-forms,-deprecated,-sizzle,
"""

Drop the minified jquery from """$(jQueryRoot)/dist/jquery.min.js""" 
to the wiki's source directory: """$(bbwRoot)/src/lib/jquery.min.js"""
