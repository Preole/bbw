Welcome to the introductory tutorial for BareBonesWiki. This 
tutorial shall get you started and ready for authoring a personal 
wiki.



Browser Support
---------------

You should first check whether your web browser supports saving 
back to the file system before using it.

1. Create a new wiki entry, save it, then press the save button 
   Follow the instructions in the popup dialog box, or download 
   the generated file into your computer.

2. Open the saved wiki with your browser, and locate the wiki 
   entry you've just created. A trip to the Titles (Alphabetical)
   index should help you locate the entry.



Basic Workflow

2. Edit the entry. If you need syntax help with editing, refer 
   to the syntax.txt page.

   Tag this entry as necessary.

3. Click on the "finish" button.
4. Repeat previous steps as needed.
5. Press the "save" button and go from there.

Other buttons, such as "Delete" should be self explanatory.



Indexing
--------

There are seven different kinds of indices available to BareBonesWiki, 
located at the upper left hand corner of the interface. You may also 
perform a simple full text search in the entire wiki through the 
text search box. These facilities are used to assist you in finding 
the entry you're looking for.

    days.

    lexicographical order.
