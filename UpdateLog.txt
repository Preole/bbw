Update Log
----------

=== 0.1.0 ===

==== Repository-Specific ====

- Removed the development branch from the repository; The branch turns 
  out unnecessary due to the simplicity of the project.

- Removed "Do not use" warning. Basic functionality and underlying engine 
  rewrites are complete.
  
- Modified """.gitattributes""" to enforce Unix-style line breaks throughout 
  the repository.

==== Project ====

- Added a selection menu for wiki entry mime type. No more manually typing 
  and guessing available types of wiki entries. There are three official types 
  of wiki entries.

  - Straight HTML """text/html"""
  - BakaBakaMark Wiki text """text/x-bbm"""
  - Plain text """text/plain"""
  
- Added the option to directly import HTML code into the wiki. No more 
  converting them into HTML mime type after importing them as plain text.
```

=== 0.1.1 ===

==== New Features ====

- Added an explicit close button for dismissing side panels.
- Added an automatic name generation for importing individual
  text files as wiki entries. The files' names shall be their
  title.

This change does not affect importing wiki entries from JSON
data sets.

- Re-arranged the editing interface to have the following order:

1. Title
2. Tags
3. Content
4. Mime type

This is to be consistent with the viewing interface, which
displays wiki entry information in that order.

- Fixed an issue where clicking on the indexing button for the
first time forces the screen to scroll to bottom in Firefox.



=== 0.1.2 ===

==== New Features ====

- Added double pipes `||` as a valid delimiter for startup wiki entry 
  titles, in addition to line breaks. (Better horizontal space utilization)
  
- Added a proper UI dashboard for managing wiki entry tags, which have the
  following controls:

  - A lookup table for existing tags.
  - A convenient text field for adding tags.
  - Tag deletion; Click on the tag.
  
  Currently, it cannot prevent adding identical tags, though they will be 
  cleaned up after committing the edit.
  
==== Fixes ====

- Wiki entries should now display the tags in alphabetical order in both 
  viewing and editing mode.

==== Project-Specific ====

- Renamed the template script file `$t.js` to `$TMPL.js`,
  avoiding letter case inconsistency in commits.

- Separated the update log from README into a separate file.
